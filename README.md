Washington, D.C. is one of a growing cadre of cities who have embraced an open data sharing model. Not only does the free (and expansive) city data make for great reference material for data scientists, city planners, 
and the like, it also pays the city back when those curious people publish open-source research on that data. It is a mutualism. 

Over the years, DC's open data hub has grown with the proliferation of big data, and now offers a high-quality dataset for any concievable research question. In the area of DC public transit alone, 
one can access the detailed performance and customer satisfaction datasets used in WMATA's quarterly reports, \n+and even use their free API to access real-time arrival time estimates, trip statuses, even train positions and speeds.
It is not a problem to have more data than you know what to do with.
